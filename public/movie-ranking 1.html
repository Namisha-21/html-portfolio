<h1>The Best Movies According to Namisha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A prison drama that makes you feel deeply for all of its characters even without the thrilling end, it would have been a fun watch for everyone.<p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>A very evenful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.<p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This movie brings a tear to your eyes. If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.<p>
